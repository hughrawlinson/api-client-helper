# Archived!

This project was fun at the time, but I didn't make progress, and the tools
have moved on, so this codebase is useless now. If anyone's interested, I
would recommend writing typescript types that represent the REST API, and
corresponding functions that generate the OpenAPI yaml out of it. Check out
[kirbysayshi]'s excellent [blog post] about typed configuration for ideas.

### API Client Library Helper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hughrawlinson/api-client-helper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hughrawlinson/api-client-helper)

A node package to help people write API client libraries, possibly even to
generate them from JSON/RAML. Very much WIP right now. Needs to handle auth.
