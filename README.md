# API Client Library Helper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hughrawlinson/api-client-helper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hughrawlinson/api-client-helper)

A node package to help people write API client libraries, possibly even to
generate them from JSON/RAML. Very much WIP right now. Needs to handle auth.
